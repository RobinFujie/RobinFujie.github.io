## About Me
**G'day 👋**
I'm a 3rd-year 現プロ生　at 北大. 

As part of the program, students are required to write a 'Project Study', which is an essay based on our choice of research.

My Project Study (PSII) will be focussing on Japanese language aquisition by my fellow 現プロ生.

Below is an outline of my PSII.

# PSII
## Overview
Due Date: December 8th 2025

本文字数: 4,750-5,500字 (excluding bibliography)

要約字数：250-300字

**PSII Thesis:** A student's motivations for and experience with learning Japanese has direct correlation with how they self-assess their language ability.

  More specifically, the more diligent a student is with their own studies and the more harsh their learning environment is, the more confident the student is in their Japanese level.

> *'diligence' referring to the degree and frequency of their self-study*

> *'harsh' referring to how strict and constructive their teachers and peers are*


## Method
An extensive Google Forms survey will be created (as per PSI).

(Most survey questions will be multiple choice - very few free-answer questions)

Interviews will be conducted after survey data is collected.

Interviews will be between 30 and 60 mins to ensure quality of responses.
